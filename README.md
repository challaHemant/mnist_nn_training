# MNIST Neural Network Training

This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network for training and evaluating on the MNIST dataset using NumPy.

## Features
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Normalizes pixel values and applies one-hot encoding.
- Neural Network Implementation: Fully connected NN with one hidden layer.
- Training Process: Includes forward pass, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
- Activation Functions: Implements Sigmoid and Softmax for classification.
- Loss Calculation: Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Keras (for loading MNIST dataset)

## Usage
Run the following to execute the script:
```bash
python mnist_nn.py
